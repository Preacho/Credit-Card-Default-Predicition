## Setting up the virtual environment ##
Create the virtual environment
```
python -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment
```
source venv/bin/activate
````
Install the needed libraries
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Pick the created virtual environment `venv` as the environment to run the  `Final_Project_Delivery.ipynb` file.
## Running the jupyter notebook ##
The file `Final_Project_Delivery.ipynb` should be run. At the end of the preprocessing section, the program writes a new file, `preprocessed_data.csv`. This file will be used by the rest of the Jupyter notebook.
